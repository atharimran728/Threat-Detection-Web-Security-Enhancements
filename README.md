# Threat Detection & Web Security Enhancements

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing crucial security measures to protect applications and systems from common cyber threats. It covers three key areas: Intrusion Detection & Monitoring, API Security Hardening, and Security Headers & Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation. The goal is to build a robust defense against unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, and various injection vulnerabilities.


## Features

This project implements the following security enhancements:

1. Intrusion Detection & Monitoring

    - *Real-time Monitoring*: Setup and configuration of tools like Fail2Ban or OSSEC for active intrusion detection.

    - *Alert Systems*: Configuration of alerts for suspicious activities, specifically multiple failed login attempts, to promptly notify administrators.

2. API Security Hardening

    - *Rate Limiting*: Implementation of express-rate-limit (for Node.js applications) to prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks on API endpoints.

    - *CORS Configuration*: Proper configuration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to restrict unauthorized domains from accessing API resources.

    - *API Authentication*: Securing API endpoints using robust authentication mechanisms such as API keys or OAuth.

3. Security Headers & CSP Implementation

    - *Content Security Policy (CSP)*: Implementation of a strong CSP to mitigate various script injection attacks (e.g., XSS) by defining trusted content sources.

    - *HTTPS Enforcement (HSTS)*: Enforcement of HTTPS using Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) headers to ensure all communication with the server is encrypted and to prevent downgrade attacks.

## Technologies Used

  Node.js (Express.js) 

- **Libraries/Packages**:

  express-rate-limit (for Node.js)

  cors (for Node.js)

- **Web Server**: Nginx, Apache (for HSTS and potentially CSP configuration)

- **Authentication**:
